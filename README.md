# Puppeteer Web Scraping Project

This is a Puppeteer-based web scraping project that allows you to scrape book data from a website. It uses Puppeteer, a Node.js library, to control a headless Chrome or Chromium browser and perform web scraping tasks.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. `browser.js`: This file exports a function `startBrowser` that opens a new browser instance using Puppeteer.

2. `pageController.js`: This file is responsible for controlling the scraping process. It requires the `browser` module and starts the browser instance.

3. `pageScraper.js`: This file contains the main scraping logic. It exports a function `scraper` that takes a browser instance and a category as input. It navigates to the specified category on a target website and scrapes book data from multiple pages within that category.

4. `data.json`: This file is generated by the scraping process and contains the scraped data in JSON format.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.

2. Run the project by executing `node pageController.js`.

3. The scraping process will start, and you will see the progress logged to the console. Once the process is complete, the scraped data will be saved in the `data.json` file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Note

Please make sure to review the website's terms of service and any applicable legal regulations before scraping any website. Always respect the website's guidelines and ensure that your scraping activities are authorized.
